# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Hospital-Patient-Reviews
This study uses sentiment analysis techniques to analyse patient reviews, providing a detailed evaluation of patient sentiment toward various hospitals, while also integrating other factors like pricing, number of doctors, and available specialties.
Tools like VADER are specifically designed to handle social media-style text and short reviews, making them ideal for healthcare settings. VADER takes into account factors like capitalization, punctuation, and emoticons, which are often present in patient reviews.

The growing importance of online reviews for hospitals has increased the need for real-time sentiment monitoring. In this study, patient feedback from hospitals has been collected and analysed using VADER, classifying each review as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, hospitals are ranked based on the sentiment of the reviews, alongside operational metrics such as pricing and the number of doctors.

The analysis allows healthcare organizations to:
•	Identify pain points: Understand the key concerns raised by patients, such as long wait times, inadequate facilities, or poor communication.
•	Measure satisfaction: Assess overall patient sentiment toward hospital services.
•	Benchmark performance: Compare hospitals on various metrics, including service quality, pricing, and the breadth of specialties.
